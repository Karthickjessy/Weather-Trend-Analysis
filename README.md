# Weather-Trend-Analysis

In this project, I am going to explore the local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends of the nearest city with the overall global temperature trends.Creating a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city. 

The Dataset has some attributes with detailed information such as:

<ul>
  <li>Year     - Year in which the observation is recorded</li>
  <li>City     - Name of the City</li>
  <li>Country  - Name of the Country</li>
  <li>Avg Temp - Average Temperature Recorded in that year</li>
</ul>
    
  This report focuses on finding some observations and trends which occurs on this dataset.
